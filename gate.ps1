    Refer this blog for clearing first step: https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=835707

    2. make sure to use Google Calendar, which enabels you to create your own schedule easily. [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
    

.PARAMETER help
    Displays this message and then exits

.PARAMETER mode
    Internally used by the Scripts in order to perform Installations or the Uninstallations
    or to open the main application, anyways its something that one mustn't use manually

.PARAMETER sch
    Again, its internally used by the Scripts in order to let the application use the system's Scheduler. 
    Don't use it manually, you can always use TaskScheduler in your own system which is way more better than this.

.PARAMETER settings
    Opens the Server with the settings page opened instead of the home page which is not default thing to do
