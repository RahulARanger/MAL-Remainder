# MAL Remainder

MAL-Remainder is an Application that allows you to update the number of episodes that you have on your `watch list` in [MyAnimeList]("https://myanimelist.net" "MyAnimeList") by regularly reminding you on the basis of events scheduled in [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/about/)'s [ICalendar File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar ".ics file").

> **Note:** So the key-point in this project, is **DYI** _[Do it yourself]_, and there's a reason for that. Most of the work done by this bot, is to modify the data in your own account, so it must be done with caution.
