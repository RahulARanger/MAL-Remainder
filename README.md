# MAL Remainder

**MAL Remainder** reminds you to update the status of your current watch list in your [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/) account, it schedules your timings in Google Calender and the internal scheduler in your device.

if its a simple increment like +2 episodes, it can auto increment for you, else you can prefer doing that so with official website, https://myanimelist.net/animelist/[Your_Name]

> **Note:** So the key-point in this project, is **DYI** _[Do it yourself]_, and there's a reason for that. Most of the work done by this bot, is to modify the data in own's account, so it must be done with caution.
