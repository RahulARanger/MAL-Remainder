MAL-Remainder is an Application that allows you to update the number of episodes that you have on your `watch list` in [MyAnimeList]("https://myanimelist.net" "MyAnimeList") by regularly reminding you on the basis of events scheduled in [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/about/)'s [ICalendar File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar ".ics file").

> **Note:**  Since this application automates things that would require authentication, setup process is bit lengthy but its only for once.
