If you have followed previous steps, then now you have to feed the values to the Application.

You may have to do this only for first time.

{: .important}
After feeding values, `Reset OAuth` it does what it supposed to [do](../Know More/api)



## Forcing ReSchedule
----

 > MAL-Remainder first checks whenever you [log-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/scheduledtasks/new-scheduledtasktrigger?view=windowsserver2022-ps#example-5-register-a-scheduled-task-that-starts-when-a-user-logs-on). if not scheduled for that day, it reschedules from your Google Calendar.

 > To force the above action, use the `ReSchedule` on settings page.



## End Result 
----

> For now you are done with setup. Rest of the processes are most probably automated, if you want to know more you can refer [here](../Know More)
