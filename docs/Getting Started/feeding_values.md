After feeding values, `Reset OAuth` it does what it supposed to [do](../Know More/api)


{: .note}
Make Sure Client ID and Client Secret are valid else you will face [this] error. if your Access Token and Refresh Tokens are not valid then you will face [this] error. And if your host or port doesn't match with the ones in API app then you will face [this] error
