It is recommended to use `localhost` for the `host`. You can also prefer `127.0.0.1` like format

{: .important}
After feeding values, go with `Reset OAuth` it does what it supposed to [do](../Know More/api)


{: .note}
Make Sure Client ID and Client Secret are valid else you will face [this](../Know%20More/api#:~:text=Possible%20Errors-,Would%20happen,-if%20either%20Client) error. if your Access Token and Refresh Tokens are not valid then you will face [this](../Know%20More/api#:~:text=Alerts-,Happens%20if%20you,-decline%20the%20OAuth) error. And if your host or port doesn't match with the ones you have written in form then you will face [this](../Know%20More/api#:~:text=Possible%20Errors-,Would%20happen,-if%20either%20Client) error


{: .highlight}
You can also import the settings and then submit it using `Refer`. But make sure if those credentials and tokens are valid else you will face their respective errors.
