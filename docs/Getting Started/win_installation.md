## Pre-requisites
---

-   Make sure you have Powershell installed on your machine and accessible with the cmdlet `powershell`. [i guess you don't need to worry about this, as it is provided by default.]

## Installation Process
---

-   **Application's Setup is build using [innosetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)**

{: .important }
While using this setup, you will definitely see PowerShell opening up in middle. That's a way to show the progress of either installation or un-installation. Make Sure **Not to close it**.

As warned above, it is recommended not to interrupt the shell process, But if you did,

-   For installation, it will prompt for cancelling the installation, if yes it removes whatever it did up until now, else it reopens the shell window ~~ðŸ˜ˆ~~ to continue the process.
-   For un-installation, closing the window, would proceed with a way [_less informative_] to uninstall files

{: .highlight}
Since this is a personal Project and it is made in simple way. So you may see certain warnings like the ones listed below. I would recommend you to ignore them. But It is possible to build this [`locally`](./Local%20Setup/Windows)


{: .note }


{: .warning }
It is possible for your anti-virus software to warn you about this application and may sometimes cancel the installation for the first time, it does because of this [setup.cmd](https://github.com/RahulARanger/MAL-Remainder/blob/master/setup.cmd). Make sure to add it to excludes.


{: .warning}
Since this Application is only self-signed you will definitely see this error <br><br>

* Closing the shell window while installation and agreeing to stop the installation,<br><br>
![Closed as request](../../assets/closed_as_requested.jpg "Closed as per request")


Most of the errors that could occur while installation would raise this message box but with a different message.

## End Result
----

At the Beginning of the Installation, Application would require 45 MB but at the end it would only consume over 35.6 MB.
